Hydrokeep is a water tracking app that allows users to stay hydrated while also donating to water charities across the globe.

Users are able to set their daily hydration goal, track water intake, learn more about clean water access and charities that support it, as well as wager donation incentives. For instance, if a user wagered $1 and they didn't reach their daily goal, the $1 would be donated to charity to aid clean water access.

Hydrokeep supports the UN Sustainability Goal #6: Clean Water & Sanitation

This React app was for Winter 2022 HCDE 438's final project.
